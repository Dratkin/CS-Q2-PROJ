                <p class = "sy_introduction">It would probably take an entire essay to describe my experience as a grade 7 scholar 
                    but to sum it up nicely, it was a school year filled with new experiences. I got to experience a little bit of 
                    what it was like in PISAY. I also had to adjust and conform to an entirely new set of demands and expectations 
                    that didn't just come with being a PISAY scholar, but being in high school as a whole. I had to get used to 
                    constantly having something to do and rarely having any time for myself. Because of this, I describe this school 
                    year as a year of adjustment and adaption to the new environment I had found myself in.

                <p class = "sy_introduction">This school year was a good year for me academic-wise since early on in the year was 
                    when I had fully adapted to life in PISAY. This allowed me to achieve what I consider to be the perfect balance 
                    between my academic life and my personal life. I was able to focus on my academic tasks as a scholar as well as 
                    the preservation of my mental health. This lead me to make and achieve great things during the school year, not 
                    least my achievement of the "Top DL" title and although it didn't really affect me that much, it gave me a huge 
                    motivation boost. Overall, I can only describe the year as a good and healthy year for me.

                <p class = "sy_introduction">Now, I know that we still aren't finished with the 9th grade yet and I know that we still have 2 
                more quarters to experience however, I just want to share my experience with this school year so far especially 
                considering that this is our first face-to-face school year here in PISAY. First of all, our entire batch is finally 
                getting a chance to socialize with each other and I'm finally getting the chance to properly catch up with my friends after 2 
                years in quarantine. Our batch is also finally experiencing what it's like to have face-to-face class discussions which are, in 
                my opinion, better than online class discussions. I have also noticed that the workload that the teachers put on us students is 
                much more bearable than the workload during online classes. Overall, it's been a good experience so far and I only wonder what's 
                coming up next.
